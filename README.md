Menu App

The Menu App is a Swift-based application designed to simulate a restaurant menu for a hypothetical Japanese restaurant. This app allows users to explore a variety of dishes, providing an engaging and interactive way to browse menu items, complete with detailed descriptions and images.


Features

- Interactive Menu: Browse through a list of delicious Japanese dishes.
- Detailed Views: Tap on a menu item to view more details, including the name, description, and price.
- SwiftUI Design: Built using SwiftUI for a modern and responsive user interface.


Getting Started

Prerequisites

- macOS with Xcode 12 or later.
- Basic understanding of Swift and SwiftUI.

Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  
   cd MenuApp
   
3. Open the project in Xcode:

   open MenuApp.xcodeproj

4. Build and run the project using the iOS Simulator or a physical device.

 Project Structure

- MenuApp.swift: The main entry point of the application where the app lifecycle is managed.
- MenuItem.swift: Contains the model for a menu item. This includes properties such as:
  - `name`: The name of the dish.
  - `description`: A brief description of the dish.
  - `price`: The cost of the dish.
- MenuView.swift: The main user interface component of the app, utilizing SwiftUI to display the list of menu items. It includes:
  - A `List` view to present all available menu items.
  - Navigation links to detailed views for each item.

How It Works

1. Menu List: Upon launching, the app displays a list of menu items.
2. Detail View: Selecting a menu item navigates to a detailed view, showing more information about the selected dish.
3. Back Navigation: Users can navigate back to the list to select another item.


Customization

You can easily customize the app by adding or modifying menu items:

1. Add a New Menu Item:
   - Open `MenuItem.swift`.
   - Create a new instance of `MenuItem` with the desired properties.

2. Modify the Menu List:
   - Open `MenuView.swift`.
   - Update the list of `MenuItem` objects to include new or modified items.


Future Enhancements

- Search Functionality: Allow users to search for menu items.
- Filter Options: Enable filtering based on categories such as appetizers, main courses, and desserts.
- Favorites: Allow users to mark their favorite dishes.
- Order Feature: Integrate an order system to simulate placing an order directly from the app.


Usage

1. Launch the App: Open the app to view the list of menu items.
2. Browse and Select: Scroll through the list and tap on any item to view its details.
3. Explore: Learn more about each dish through detailed descriptions and pricing.
